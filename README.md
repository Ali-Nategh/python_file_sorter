# python_file_sorter

A project created to sort my cluttered messy folders lol

```
This is a File sorter that sorts image and video files by extentions.

You can use it in a command line like this:
sorter.py SourcePath DestinationPath

If the file matches the written extentions, then it looks up the file creation and modification dates, creates a folder with the files creation or modification year (picks the one that is lower than the other), and it will copy the file to that path using read and write (not using any libraries like shutil or ... was intentional and intended as a challenge)

You can change this a bit and use it for your own sorting purposes if you want lol.
Have fun!
```
